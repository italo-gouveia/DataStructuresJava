Definition: A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix. It is particularly useful for storing and searching for strings efficiently.

Applications:

Auto-complete features in text editors and search engines.
Dictionary implementations where searching for words with common prefixes is frequent.
